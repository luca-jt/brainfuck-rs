# brainfuck-rs
A simple interpreter for the Brainfuck programming language written in Rust.\
There is a ```./test/hello_world.bf``` and a ```./test/hello_world2.bf``` file for testing.\
The second one is a one that makes many interpreters fail as a result of being too restrictive.\
There is also a ```./test/mandelbrot.bf``` file that displays an ASCII image of the mandelbrot set.

# Usage
- run from the terminal: ``<brainfuck-rs-exe-path> <bf-file-path>``
